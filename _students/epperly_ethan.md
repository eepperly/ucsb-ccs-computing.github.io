Ethan Epperly is a 4th year CCS Computing and CCS Mathematics double major from Livermore, CA.  His interests are in computational modelling of structural materials, fast algorithms for structured linear systems, and machine learning. Ethan has worked for five summers at [Sandia National Labs](http://www.sandia.gov), and is currently doing research with the [UCSB Scientific Computing Group](http://scg.ece.ucsb.edu). He has presented his work in a talk *Towards a Fully Algebraic Generalization of SSS to 2D Operators* at [SIAM CS&E 2019](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/cse19), and is now in the process of publishing [a manuscript based on this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05858). Ethan was selected as one of the [41 finalists for the competitive Hertz foundation fellowship](https://hertzfoundation.org/news/pressrelease/1532/41-Finalists-Named-for-the-2019-Hertz-Fellowships) and is excited to continue his work on computational linear algebra next year as a PhD student. When he is not writing code or proving martingale inequalities, Ethan can be found listening to music or playing board games.
